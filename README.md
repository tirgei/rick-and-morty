# Rick & Morty 

This app consumes data from the Rick & Morty [API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/). The app is built using Kotlin and encompasses 
the Clean Architecture principle with MVVM approach and Jetpack libraries.

You can download the test apk here - [Rick & Morty](art/rick-and-morty.apk).

## Project Setup 
To setup the project in your machine

- Clone the repo

```console
foo@bar:~$ git clone https://github.com/tirgei/rick-and-morty.git
```

- Set the BASE_URL in the ```local.properties``` file.

You can then import the project to your Android Studio

## Architecture
The app is divided into 3 modules, namely:
- Presentation (app)
- Data
- Domain

This approach is guided by the clean architecture approach which advocates for clear abstraction of the flow 
of data from the business logic to the presentation framework dealing with displaying data to the user. 

#### Presentation
The ```app``` module contains the UI and navigation frameworks and also deals with instantiation of DI
components for the app. [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) is used to render data to the UI while 
the [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) provides a link to the ```data``` module
via the respective [UseCase](https://proandroiddev.com/why-you-need-use-cases-interactors-142e8a6fe576) s.

#### Data
The ```data``` module deals with loading data from the sample response server. The app is persisted to local cache using [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room).
- ```cache``` package - contains classes dealing with offline persistence
- ```remote``` package - contains classes dealing with fetching data from the API.

#### Domain
The ```domain``` module mainly deals with the model classes which presents the data being used across both the 
```presentation``` module and the ```data``` module.

It defines the UseCase(s) which handle the flow of data from the Repository layer to the ViewModel. It also defines 
the Repository interfaces which the ```data``` module implements to provide data access.
